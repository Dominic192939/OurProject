## Necessity of Project

First of all, there are already some simular apps on the market. But there ain't apps which combines all of our social features.
Its a app to connect motorcycle riders, car people and even people who want to socialise while doing sports / walks.
If we manage to get many users it can easily be extended to more activities and be even more interesting for a lot of people.

With our skills at the moment we are only able to simulate a easy version of our Project (see first Milestone).
Later this year we will be able to create our first application with frontend features and working backend code.
