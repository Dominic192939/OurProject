## Necessity of Project

First of all, there are already some simular apps on the market. But there ain't apps which combines all of our social features.
Its a app to connect motorcycle riders, car people and even people who want to socialise while doing sports / walks.
If we manage to get many users it can easily be extended to more activities and be even more interesting for a lot of people.


## Feasibilty of Project

With our skills at the moment we are only able to simulate a easy version of our Project (see first Milestone).
Later this year we will be able to create our first application with frontend features and working backend code.


## Affordability of Project

1.) The project budget: We will provide a detailed cost estimation which contains the following expenses: personal, technology, graphic designs and needed hardware.

2.) Life cycle costing: When releasing the final version of our project, there will be a alpha and beta test phase. Bugs and issues fixing will take around 1 month, depending on our progress.
Still we could always expand our Project and add new Features if needed and wanted by the community.
So the life cycle costings are depending on many factors.

3.) Sustainability: Our project is one of the first apps on the market, which combines a lot of different social activities. 
That means a user doesn't have to install for e.g. 3 apps if he could use our app for everything.
We even could transform our app to a social media platform like instagram, users could add photos of themselves, hobbies and so on to make new social contacts that suit her/his lifestyle.


## Market and economic effect of Project

We will provide our annual sales via advertisements, premium upgrade versions and extra features.
As already mentioned, we combine a lot of features of other apps in only one app. This will have a serious impact on the market effect of the project.
