### First Milestone
The first step should be that we discuss the ideas together and think about how we should proceed.

### Second Milestone
The second step is to document the most important thing, because a project needs a good protocol.

### Third Milestone
The next step is to code a prototype. In the prototype, a main menu should be created where you have a wide variety of options. 
The choice of routes depends on what you choose. You can choose from a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle and a selection for runners.

### Fourth Milestone
If you choose a car, the program should be able to independently calculate routes that you would like to drive. 
Different routes are displayed, such as people who want to drive on relaxed roads or people who prefer winding roads.

### Small goals per milestone:

#### 1.Milestone

The first goal is to find a project idea.
Second goal is to think about what you need. Also think about how much time the project will take.
Divide the team into who has what task on the project.

#### 2.Milestone
Document everything on Github and, depending on your choice, in VSCODE.
Show the professor how far we are and wait for feedback.

#### 3.Milestone
At the third milestone, the first small goal is to program a prototype.
First, you should choose the perfect programming language.

Then the person who was hired as technical support will be his
To complete the task by creating a prototype.

The prototype should have certain functions such as a menu with lots of options to choose from.
Route calculation depending on the type of transport.

#### 4.Milestone
With the 4 Milestone the function of selecting cars, motorcycles etc. of some dimensions works well.
If that works then route calculation shouldn't be an obstacle.
