### First Milestone
The first step should be that we discuss the ideas together and think about how we should proceed.

### Second Milestone
The second step is to document the most important thing, because a project needs a good protocol.

### Third Milestone
The next step is to code a prototype. In the prototype, a main menu should be created where you have a wide variety of options. 
The choice of routes depends on what you choose. You can choose from a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle and a selection for runners.

### Fourth Milestone
If you choose a car, the program should be able to independently calculate routes that you would like to drive. 
Different routes are displayed, such as people who want to drive on relaxed roads or people who prefer winding roads.
