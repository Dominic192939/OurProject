## Planning:

We want to use a app application and a web app.

The Frontend should be design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the backend we want to use C# or Python. In our Project we use a map similar to google for the location of the other users. Our Project should detect traffic jams and give you the best detour. Our Project has a feedback feature. We want to show the user the number of kilometers traveled and the consumption depending on the vehicle. For security reasons, we want the user to be removed from the map after a trip, If the user wants to continue driving, the location will be activated again. 

We need: 

1. **Frontend:** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) 
1. **Backend:** (C# || Python)
1. **Database:** (SQL)
