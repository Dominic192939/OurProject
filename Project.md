The name of this Project: RideSocial

The project that the three of us have thought about is especially for the motorcyclists, for people who like to socialise while doing sports for e.g. runners, walkers... and also for car drivers! 

We want to conncet people that like going outside and meet so new people. We think it's an fun activity and also good for heath. Especially people that not really often go outside. People with mental problems could be a good chance to meet new people and enjoy the weather.
