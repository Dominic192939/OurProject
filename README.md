# Project
## This is our first real Project!!!
The project that the three of us have thought about is especially for the motorcyclists, 
for people who like to ride bikes, for runners and also for car drivers.

The name of this Project: Universal 

## Initial situation
In the end, a function-free app should be programmed. 
This app is intended to search different routes. 
Available are winding roads, relaxed roads, mountainous roads, forest crossings and finally city travel roads.

## Project goal
The goal is to create a functional program to connect with other people! Socialising is a important aspect of our life and some things are funnier with more people and eventually it builds the one or other friendship.
Our program is designed for people who want to walk / run / drive together with strangers.

# Vehicles
For drivers, you can pick your own drive style (for e.g. slow pace, moderate pace or fast pace) or you don't care and adapt to your group.
Another function will be, that you can search for your own range of hoursepower, so you will have no disadvantage or advantages. This feature can also be ignored by the user.
Also you can decide if you want to ride in a small group (1-4 Members), medium group (4-6), large group (6-12) or you pick your own size (may take longer to connect with others).

# Non-Vehicles
For other people, you can also socialise and search for other people to e.g. go for a walk or running some routes.
As already mentioned for vehicles, you can search for single person groups, small, medium and large groups.
