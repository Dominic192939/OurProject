## ProjectGoal

The goal is to create a functional program to connect with other people! Socialising is a important aspect of our life and some things are funnier with more people and eventually it builds the one or other friendship.
Our program is designed for people who want to walk / run / drive together with strangers.

In our project, we aim to incorporate a feedback feature. We envision a sidebar on the left-hand side for information, such as personal stats, e.g., duration of current rides or frequency of app usage per week. Within this sidebar, we plan to include a feature focused on friends. Users will be able to add friends within the app and see if they are currently at a specific location. Additionally, it will provide links to their social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Our goal is to enable users to review their activity within the app.
